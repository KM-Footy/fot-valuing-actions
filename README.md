# Friends of Tracking: Valuing actions in football

This repository provides presentations and tutorials that demonstrate how to value on-the-ball actions in football.

The tutorials use the open-source [socceraction](https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/socceraction) Python library and the publicly available [Wyscout match event dataset](https://figshare.com/collections/Soccer_match_event_dataset/4415000). The dataset includes data for the 2017/2018 English Premier League, the 2017/2018 Spanish Primera Divisi√≥n, the 2017/2018 German 1. Bundesliga, the 2017/2018 Italian Serie A, the 2017/2018 French Ligue 1, the 2018 FIFA World Cup and the UEFA Euro 2016. The dataset covers 1,941 matches, 3,251,294 events and 4,299 players.

### Introduction in Friends of Tracking ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0LX-2UgyXU))
This introductory presentation, which was given in the [Friends of Tracking](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUBFJYcag8j2rm_9HkrrA7w) session that took place on Thursday 7 May 2020, motivates the use of data for player recruitment in football, shows the limitations of traditional statistics to assess the performances of football players, introduces a number of frameworks for valuing actions of football players, provides an intuitive explanation of the VAEP framework for valuing actions of football players, and introduces the content of this series of hands-on video tutorials.

This presentation expands on the content of the introductory presentation by discussing the technicalities behind the VAEP framework for valuing actions of football players as well as the content of the hands-on video tutorials in more depth.

### Tutorial 1: Run pipeline ([notebook](notebooks/tutorial1-run-pipeline.ipynb), [notebook on Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SciSports-Labs/fot-valuing-actions/blob/master/notebooks/tutorial1-run-pipeline.ipynb))
This tutorial demonstrates the entire pipeline of ingesting the raw Wyscout match event data to producing ratings for football players. This tutorial touches upon the following four topics: downloading and preprocessing the data, valuing game states, valuing actions and rating players.

### Tutorial 2: Generate features
