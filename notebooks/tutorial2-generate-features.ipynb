    "# Tutorial: Generate features\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to generate features to represent game states to value on-the-ball actions of football players with the open-source [VAEP framework](https://github.com/ML-KULeuven/socceraction) using the publicly available [Wyscout match event dataset](https://figshare.com/collections/Soccer_match_event_dataset/4415000). The Wyscout dataset includes data for the 2017/2018 English Premier League, the 2017/2018 Spanish Primera DivisiÃ³n, the 2017/2018 German 1. Bundesliga, the 2017/2018 Italian Serie A, the 2017/2018 French Ligue 1, the 2018 FIFA World Cup, and the UEFA Euro 2016. Covering 1,941 matches, 3,251,294 events and 4,299 players, the dataset is large enough to train machine-learning models and obtain robust ratings for the players.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates the following three steps:\n",
    "   1. Investigate the data in SPADL representation.\n",
    "   2. Construct features to represent actions.\n",
    "   3. Construct features to represent game states.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conventions:**\n",
    "   * Variables that refer a `DataFrame` object are prefixed with `df_`.\n",
    "   * Variables that refer a collection of `DataFrame` objects (e.g., a list, a set or a dict) are prefixed with `dfs_`.\n",
